<h1>Teen Crash Vanløse</h1>
Welcome to my first project, a very small and simple site called: 'Teen Crash Vanløse' (TCV). The purpose of the webpage is to provide basic information about a youth group I am currently leading in Vanløse in the heart of Copenhagen.

The  group is a 7-9pm Thursday hangout for all kids aged 14-16. We play games, set up fun competetions and give the kids an inspirational input before sending them off. 
This site can like Facebook and Instagram, be helpful to find information about the youth group as well as be a platform where parents and people who don't know us, can explore a little about who we are, where we are and what we do.

Simple but sweet (..or at least usefull). Enjoy. 



<h2>UX</h2>
One of the primary goals behind this site is to provide information about Teen Crash Vanløse in a very simple and clear way.
The kids should first and foremost be able to immediately find the program for the next Thursday hangout thus you will find that on the homepage.
This information is also availble on our Facebook page however, this site is a lot less cluttery and has a lot fewer links than facebook. One click, arriving to the homepage and you have the program.

The other few and simple features should be easily found without any confusion or random clutter of adds or unnecesary effects.
These includes: how to contact us, information about who we are and what we do, how to find us, as well as a small gallery where, fx parents, can get an idea on what we do at an actual Thursday hangout.
There are a totalt of six buttons on the nav-bar which is not much and should not cause confusion.

I have deliberately put the more important buttons of the nav-bar on the sides and the possibly lesser used ones in the middle. Eg.
If you're not looking for the program (which is on the HP), you would possible be interested in a little general information about us or how to find us (the right-most buttons).


It is my belief that the eyes first skip to the end if not immediately finding what they are looking for thus placing whats expected to be least useful 'hidden' somewhere in between. 

Other than that, the site is build like what users expect to see: a webpage with a standard header, a nav-bar just below followed by the main section and the footer at the bottom.
All sections identical from page to page (except of course the content in the mid sections) so it doesn't confuse when clicking a link changing the page.

<h3>Tools & resources</h3>
<ul>
<li> The total six pages on the webpage was first outlined in Balsamiq Mockups v3.15.17. The final product ended up quite close to the inital idea and can be found here: https://github.com/ableskewer/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project/tree/master/assets/resources/tc-mockups 
</li>
<li>Sitemap can be found here https://github.com/ableskewer/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project/tree/master/assets/resources
- or in the footer of the webpage.
</li></ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

The features on the webpage includes:

<h3><b>Existing Features</b></h3>
<h4>Nav-bar (Left to right)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Button 1 - A visible and downloadable program (pdf) quickly and easily accessibly to parents and participants of Teen Crash Vanløse. </li>
<li>Button 2 - A contact page where users who are new to TCV or not yet in contact with us can fill out a contact form inteded for an inbox of leaders of TCV.</li>
<li>Button 3 - A non-interactive gallery (Billeder) where users quickly get a feel of the atmosphere of hangouts at TCV. Bridges the gap to those who don't attend but someway still have interest in the youth group.</li>
<li>Button 4 - "Dem Vi er!?", meaning "Who We Are!?" - a page who connects outsiders with the leaders of TCV providing a small description as well as personal contact information (for those leaders who are willing to share). Further helps create a connection between those who do not know us.</li>
<li>Button 5 - "Find os!", meaning "Find us". Very much self-explanatory. Google maps rocks!
<li>Feature 6 - A simple textpage with basic information about TCV and a few quotes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other</h4>

<ul>
<li>The footer connects users to Facebook or Instagram as well as it provides a text-based sitemap. As the footer is very empty the two icons stand out which makes up for the current lack of reference to Facebook/Instagram from other places on the webpage. </li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Features Left to Implement</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>The site could be more connected with hints here and there providing information about this and that.
It appears quite empty as of now and could easily hold more content without feeling flooded.</li>
<li>The "Dem vi er!?"-page needs to be updated with a fitting description as well as pictures of other leaders</li>
<li>Video content page showing former fun and interesting hangout events.</li>
<li>Short promotional videos, perhaps running on the homepage making the site more lively.</li>
<li>Visual 'goodies' in form of hover-effects or effects upon loading of the site. etc. The options are vast and making the site more lively and dynamic appearing more timely/vibrant/cool.</li>
<li>Recruitment page where information can be found about how to get connected as a leader, what it takes and what profile we're looking. Voluntary work always needs more volunteers.
<li>Stay in contact function, eg. sign-up for newsletter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
<li>HTML5<ul>
<li>The project uses HTML5 - Why? Its the only language I know for building webpages and it is awesome.</li>
<li>A lot of inspiration for the HTML part of the build has come from https://www.w3schools.com/html/ as well as from https://stackoverflow.com/ and of course https://codeinstitute.net/</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>CSS3<ul>
<li>The project uses CSS3 for styling of the webpage. </li>
<li>A lot of inspiration for the HTML part of the build has come from https://www.w3schools.com/css/ as well as from https://stackoverflow.com/ and of course https://codeinstitute.net/</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Google fonts<ul>
<li>The project uses two fonts from https://fonts.google.com/: Bangers & Source Sans Pro as the browser in themselves dont hold enough interesting fonts.</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Hover effects<ul>
<li>One or two hover effects are used using https://cdnjs.com/libraries/hover.css. Used to make the webpage a little more vibrant and lively. 
</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Logos from Font Awesome<ul>
<li>Facebook and Instagram logo gotten from https://kit.fontawesome.com/. The logos are nice and everybody recognizes them and what they do.
</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Bootstrap4 (CSS3, JavaScrip) and jQuery?<ul>
<li>Those technologies have NOT been used but CDN libraries are added in the code, ready to be called upon.
</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<ul><li>Links<ul><li>All links work (very very few links) as it was found when creating the sitemap.xml file using the free service of http://www.sitemaps.org.</li>
</li></ul></ul>

<ul><li>Contact form<ul><li>The "Send" button only works when all three fields have been filled out.  Takes 5 seconds to test. Works as inteded although there are no receiving end for the messages yet.</li>
</li></ul></ul>

<ul><li>Google maps<ul><li>Clicking on "find os" you will see the Google Maps loading in the embedded window and that all functions: zooming in-out, clicking and moving etc. works as intended.</li>
</li></ul></ul>

I have constantly been looking at the site at Google Chrome and Mozilla FireFox and it appears the same to me on both browsers. 

The code has been modified to display the site in a reasonable way on all devices using different size media queries. The way I have been testing this is by narrowing the screen after pressing F12 (both in Chrome and Firefox) and dragging the window smaller and bigger left to right, vise versa.

I have found no bugs on the page, most likely because it is too simple to have bugs. I am still very inexperienced so perhaps they do exist and I just don't how to make them appear.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
As this project webpage is written in Gitpod and stored and saved on GitHub it is deployed through GitHub Pages, currently visible through a temporary adress: https://ableskewer.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project/.

There are currently no differences between the development version and the live version.

<h2>Credits</h2>
I found inspiration on font-shadows from stackoverflow.com forums.
Also: css-tricks.com has been helpful learning about different kinds of styling.

<h3><b>Content</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>All text and code has been written by myself. As I recall. It is not very advanced. Nothing worth stealing/borrowing.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Media</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>All photos are selfobtained taken by either myself or other leaders from Teen Crash Vanløse via thier phones. Except for the one photo of myself on the "Demvier!?"-page which is taken by David Wanninger @DanskOase.dk.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Acknowledgements</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>The simple and very limited project was inspired by myself. But thanks goes out to my fellow leaders, Rebecca, Jonatan and Andreas who I really enjoy working with at TCV.</li>
